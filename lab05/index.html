        <p>Welcome to my HTML webpage. Honestly this tasks what not easy. As simple as this webpage may look, I was faced with so many challenges because of the many tags you can explore. I hope with time this will become second nature to me!</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="#example1">What I Learned</a></li>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learning HTML takes patience</li>
            <li>Always look for gramatic errors</li>
            <li>You wont get it overnight but with time, you can become an HTML genius!(I hope)</li>

            <h4>What I like About HTML So Far:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There are so many options to choose from.</li>
                <li>You can create anything to your own liking.</li>

            <p> Lab 02: This first lab was very fun to get my hands on, and as soon as I did, it started to make more sense</p>
            <p>Lab 03: This third Lab was a bit more challenging, but it was definitely more fun. I love styling the file with different colors and making it my own</p>
            <p>Lab 05: This fifth lab was way more challenging than the previous ones, in my opinion. My biggest struggle was getting my media queries to work with such a small page to begin with. I realized that adding more sctructure helped me a lot.. I won't give up!</p>  
            <p>Learning about HTML seems pretty intersting so far. I've learned alot from my teacher and this website here:</p>
