    <h1>My Reflection:</h1>
    <p>Suprisingly, even though this was my first time creating a Tier List Table, it wasn't that hard as I expected it to be. The videos my teacher implemented in the module helped me alot because I was able to visually see what was going on, and also test it out in the process. I also like how I was able to add the pictures, so viewers can get more insight of the products. Overall, this was a great experience. I wouldn't mind doing it again!</p>
